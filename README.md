A header-only Reed-Solomon codes implementation.

It's not in the AUR because I
didn't have time to figure out every nuance needed before uploading PKGBUILD,
and also that I seriously doubt package usefulness, but otherwise it's
maintained, so report any problems or new versions.

# Installation

Execute:

	makepkg

…to build the package, then:

	sudo pacman -U package.tar.gz

…for installation.
